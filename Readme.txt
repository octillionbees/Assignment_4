For whatever reason, this program stops working after the resets in Sample 1. I know that this is an issue, as well as
the fact that I haven't implemented the logic for the cache read & write and the cache write & read. However, I have had
an extremely long day, and I'd rather just be done with this for now. I'll take a look at it again and make sure to fix
the bugs before assignment 5. Thank you!
